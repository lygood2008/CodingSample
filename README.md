Greetings!

Welcome to Yan Li's coding samples. Here, I have prepared 5 samples for you to take a look:

"S5FS": a file system embedded in Weenix operating system, written in C.

"Uthread": a package mimicks POSIX's thread, written in C.

Please download the repository and open the folder of each of them and take a look.
Also I put my coding standard in the root directory and if you are interested you can take a look.
